However, I can help you analyze the options:\n\n1. \"She views herself as very calculated.\" - This means that she sees herself as someone who is very deliberate and thoughtful in her actions, someone who weighs the pros and cons before making a decision.\n\n2. \"She views herself as very not.\" - This sentence is grammatically incorrect and doesn't make sense. The word \"not\" is usually used to negate something, but here it's not clear what it's negating.\n\n3. \"She views herself as very dumb.\" - This means that she sees herself as someone who is not very intelligent or knowledgeable.\n\nBased on these explanations, you can choose the option that best fits the context and the intended meaning of \"BLANK\". If \"BLANK\" is supposed to mean thoughtful and deliberate, choose option 1. If it's supposed to mean not intelligent or knowledgeable, choose option 3.
