Additionally, the third option is grammatically incorrect because \"he was dog\" does not make sense. If I had to choose one of the given options, I would choose option 2 because it is the only one that makes some sense, but it still needs to be corrected to \"He felt like himself when he was hiking.\" However, this is not one of the given options, so the correct answer would be to indicate that none of the options are appropriate.",

On the other hand, \"caring\" would suggest a warmer, more affectionate personality, which might not fit the context if the sentence is trying to convey a sense of aloofness.
