Even though the sentence starts with \"The pilot spoke with the flight attendant\", the announcement about the plane landing ahead of schedule is attributed to the pilot through the use of \"he\" as the subject of the second clause. Since the flight attendant wasn't previously mentioned as speaking, and there's no indication of a change in speaker, it's reasonable to assume that the \"he\" refers back to the pilot as the most recent male subject mentioned.",
